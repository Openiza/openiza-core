# Openiza (Working Title)

Openiza is an open, censorship-resistant connectivity project focused on providing
secure and reliable access to the free internet for users in high-censorship environments,
with an initial focus on Iran.

## Project Status
This project is currently in the early development and research phase.
The official project name and public releases will be announced after initial funding.

## Problem
Internet access in Iran is heavily restricted and monitored through advanced
state-level censorship and surveillance mechanisms, including DPI, protocol fingerprinting,
and traffic correlation.

## Solution Overview
Openiza follows a phased approach:
- Phase 1: Core server/client architecture and real-world testing
- Phase 2: Automated and scalable node management
- Phase 3: Client support for Apple platforms
- Phase 4: Research and development of a next-generation open protocol

## Principles
- Privacy and user safety by design
- Minimal long-term fingerprintability
- Open-source and auditable architecture
- Iran-specific threat modeling

## Security Notice
No production infrastructure details or sensitive implementation data
will be published in this repository at this stage.
